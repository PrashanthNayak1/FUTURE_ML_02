This project develops a Customer Churn Prediction System that identifies which customers are most likely to stop using a serviceâ€”an essential tool for industries like telecom, SaaS, and banking where retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Using real-world customer data, I performed data cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., contract type, payment method, service usage), and trained classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC, with churn probabilities calculated at the customer level. To make the insights actionable, I visualized churn drivers and key metrics in an interactive Power BI dashboard and built clear business-focused recommendations. This project highlights skills in machine learning, data wrangling, and business analytics, demonstrating how predictive modeling can reduce churn risk and improve customer retention strategies.
